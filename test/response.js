			"Addicting and dangerous. When I was in the thick of it my nights were restless as my brain continued to spin on my factory and various ideas for its refactoring. I also suddenly can&#x27;t not see our global economy and its gradual automation as a massive ongoing MMORPG game of Factorio. The end state then becomes as clear as the state of my final factory - we&#x27;d feed raw renewable energy into the system and automatically manufacture an abundance of all goods that people desire. Maybe they all just pop out of the automaton and we gradually lose ability to understand it, fix it, improve it, etc. Depressing. :)",
